I had the opportunity to return to Pabna University of Science and Technology (PUST) to share a research seminar titled “Grow Your Knowledge: A Roadmap for Your First Research Adventure.” It was wonderful to connect with undergraduate students who are just beginning to explore the world of academic research. During the session, I walked through the entire research journey—from finding a meaningful problem and reviewing literature, to designing experiments, writing papers, and eventually sharing your work with the world. I also shared some of my own project examples, like UDBRNet, UDBA-UNet and EDLDNet, to illustrate how ideas move from concept to publication.

Beyond the technical roadmap, we talked honestly about the practical realities of doing research in Bangladesh—from working with limited resources and access to computation devices, to navigating publication costs and building an academic presence in international conferences. What stood out most was the students’ enthusiasm and thoughtful questions. My hope is that this seminar gave them a clearer, more confident starting point for their own research adventures.
