I hold an MSc from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology <strong>(BUET)</strong> (GPA 3.92/4.00, top 1%), where my thesis introduced a <strong>A uncertainty-driven boundary-refined CNN for medical image segmentation</strong>. My research contributions include <strong>Efficient segmentation network, attention-based architectures, adaptive loss functions for small tumor segmentation, and radiomics-driven cancer classification</strong>, with publications in leading journals and conferences such as <strong>PLOS ONE, and IEEE ISBI</strong>. I am also part of the <a href="https://biorainlab.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BioRAIN research group</a>, collaborating on cutting-edge projects in biomedical imaging and AI.</p> <p>I am now actively <strong>seeking a PhD opportunity</strong> in the fields of <strong>computer vision, deep learning, and medical imaging</strong>, aiming to advance research on <strong>robust segmentation models, multi-scale feature learning, and uncertainty quantification</strong>. With hands-on experience in Python, PyTorch, and large-scale experimentation, I bring both technical expertise and a proven research record. My goal is to contribute to impactful, interdisciplinary research that bridges <strong>AI and real-world healthcare challenges</strong>.</p> </body></html>
