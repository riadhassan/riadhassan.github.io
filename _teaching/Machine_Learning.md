### Course Description

The Machine Learning course provides a comprehensive exploration of the principles, algorithms, and applications that underpin the field of machine learning. The curriculum covers fundamental concepts such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as advanced topics like deep learning and natural language processing.

Through a combination of theoretical lectures, practical exercises, and hands-on projects, students will develop a deep understanding of various machine learning techniques and their real-world applications. The course emphasizes the theoretical foundations of machine learning algorithms, teaching students how to preprocess data, select appropriate algorithms, and evaluate their performance.

### Course Rationale

The science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, efficient web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine-learning techniques and practice putting them to use. You will not only learn about the theoretical underpinnings of learning but also gain the practical knowledge required to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques.
